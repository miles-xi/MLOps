#### 01 - intro

"docker run hello-world" command initiates a process to demonstrate that a Docker installation is functioning correctly. This command triggers a series of actions within the Docker ecosystem

1. 
Docker client = command-line interface. 
Docker engine / daemon = the background service that manages Docker objects like images, containers, and volumes.

Docker client sends "run hello-world" to the Docker engine.

2.
Docker checks if the "hello-world" image is found locally. If not Docker will pull the image.

3.
Once the image is available the Docker engine creates a new container from the image. This container is an isolated environmemt that runs a small program embedded within the hello-world image. The program's sole purpose is to print "Hello from Docker!" to the standard output.

4.
The output generated by the program within the container is then streamed back from the Docker engine to the Docker client, which in turn displays it in the user's terminal.


wget & bash are Linux command-line tools. 
wget: download from the web. 
bash: a command line shell and scripting language for Linux

wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh  

bash Anaconda3- ...sh: run Anaconda


Port: a virtual communication endpoint. Port forwarding creates a bridge between the port on your local machine and the port inside the remote machine (where Jupyter runs)

When you run something inside a remote env (for example Codespaces) the service is inside that machine not on your laptop.
